# Deploy a Python/Flask web app to Azure

This is a simple web app using Python and Flask that's deployed on Azure. I made this to learn about deploying apps on Azure, because I'd never used Azure before. In the future all of my apps will probably be deployed on Azure instead of Heroku or GitHub.

<!-- This is the sample Flask application for the Azure Quickstart [Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).  For instructions on how to create the Azure resources and deploy the application to Azure, refer to the Quickstart article.

A Django sample application is also available for the article at [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart).

If you need an Azure account, you can [create on for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). -->
